# Tank Textadventure
## About the Game
The game is a small but fun text-adventure that allows you to command a tank in a high-stakes battle against enemy tanks. As the commander, you have the freedom to choose the number of tanks that you will encounter in the battle, some of which will be friendly. The game will automatically adjust the difficulty level based on your individual skills, ensuring that the game remains challenging and engaging throughout.

The game features simple yet random gameplay, thanks to its randomized generation system. As you progress through the game, various elements, such as enemy tank placement and events, will be generated randomly, providing you with a new experience each time you play. However, the outcome of the game will solely depend on your own skills and decision-making abilities. Your strategic thinking, quick reflexes, and tactical prowess will determine the success of your mission.

At the end of the game, you will receive a score and stats that reflect how well you performed. Your score will be calculated based on various factors such as the number of enemy tanks destroyed, the amount of upgrades done, and the overall time taken to complete the mission.

To start playing this game, all you need to do is run `tank.py` with your Python installation (Version 3.7+).

## About the Project
I developed this game as a personal challenge over the course of an extended weekend in 2020. With only four days to work with, I quickly came up with a fun idea that would put players in the driver's seat of a tank, testing their skills as a commander. Despite the tight deadline, I managed to create something fun that I'm proud of.

After leaving the game untouched for some time, I now decided to share it, and its source code, with the world. I wanted to preserve the game and allow others to enjoy it or create their own fork, continuing their own development.

Originally, the game had an online integration that saved players' high scores to an online database. However, I ultimately decided to remove this feature as I was not happy with how it had been implemented. While the feature was intended to enhance the game's replay value and encourage competition among players, I felt that it did not meet the high standards set by the game itself, and therefore made the decision to remove it.
